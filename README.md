I am Byeongyeon Kim, :man_student: sophomore in the [Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering](https://computer.seoultech.ac.kr/), [SEOULTECH](https://www.seoultech.ac.kr/).

I work in :speaking_head: English Language-Teaching Industry, mainly at private academy (1:N) or tutoring (1:1 extracurricular lesson).
If studying English (such as making 900+ score in TOEIC :joy:) is on your mind, you can contact me through **rlaquddus@gmail.com** freely.

We may hit it off if you are interested in:
